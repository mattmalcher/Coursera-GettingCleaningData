# Introduction

This repository contains the R code, Codebook and Readme which together make up my submission for the Week 4 project of the 'Getting & Cleaning Data' Coursera module.

This readme describes the project structure; how the scripts work and how they are connected.

Credit goes to David Hood who has written a really useful guide to the project which can be found [here]( https://thoughtfulbloke.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/getting-and-cleaning-the-assignment/).
